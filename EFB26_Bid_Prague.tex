\paragraph{Charles University} (Latin: Universitas Carolina) is the oldest and
largest university in the Czech Republic. It is one of the oldest
universities in Europe in continuous operation.
% 

\paragraph{The Czech Academy of Sciences} is the leading non-university public
research institution in the Czech Republic. Its tradition goes back to
the Royal Bohemian Society of Sciences founded in 1784. The Academy
conducts both fundamental and strategic applied research. The
  Nuclear Physics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences, a
public research institution, conducts research in a broad field of
nuclear physics, experimental as well as theoretical.
%

\paragraph{Prague} with its rich history and stunning architecture is one of the
world's most popular tourist destinations. It is classified as an
``Alpha-{}'' global city according to GaWC studies. Prague ranked sixth
in the Tripadvisor world list of best destinations in 2016 (fifth in
2014). Furthermore, the city was ranked 7th in the world ICCA
Destination Performance Index measuring performance of conference
tourism in 2021.


\section*{Travel}
\noindent
%
Due to its location in the heart of Europe, Prague is easily
accessible. The most popular ways of getting to Prague are by plane or
by train. Prague has an extensive public transport network that is
rated as one of the best and most reliable in Europe.

{\bf Troja Campus, transport:} It is possible to travel to Troja by public transport, the closest bus stops being “Kuchyňka”
and “Pelc Tyrolka”. Alternatively, the campus is about 15 minutes walk from the metro station “Nádraží Holešovice”
(line C). It is also possible to drive to the campus by car. It is possible to park in front of the main entrance or in the courtyard;
parking is free and accessible nonstop.


\section*{Local Organizing Committee (preliminary)}
\noindent
%
The conference will be organized by a mixed committee of scientists from ÚJF, Řež and MFF UK, Prague.
The local organizing committee will include:
\begin{t_sq_itemize}
\item Nina Shevchenko, chair (ÚJF, Řež; theory)
\item Martin Čížek (MFF UK, Prague; theory)
\item Zdeněk Doležal (MFF UK, Prague; experiment)
\item Tomáš Dytrych (ÚJF, Řež; theory)
\item Daniel Gazda (ÚJF, Řež; theory)
\item Karel Houfek (MFF UK, Prague; theory)
\item Jiří Mareš (ÚJF, Řež; theory)
\item Zdeněk Mašín (MFF UK, Prague; theory)
\end{t_sq_itemize}
\dg{Exp.\ UOCHB, JH?}

\section*{International Advisory Committee and time schedule}
\noindent
%
Members will be chosen from the lists of advisors from past conferences. New names
will be added in consultation with the European few-body research committee to ensure that all
areas of few-body research are covered. 

We assume to set the IAC to the summer 2024, they will be asked to suggest the invited speakers. 
The first announce about the EFB26 conference will be done in the autumn 2024, the web page
should be already ready at that time.

\section*{Topics}
\noindent
The following topics will be covered at the conference:
\begin{t_sq_itemize}
\item Nuclei and hypernuclei
\item Hadron physics
\item Electroweak processes
\item Nuclear astrophysics
\item Cold atoms and quantum gases
\item Atoms and molecules
\item Few-body methods
\item Few-body aspects of many-body systems
\end{t_sq_itemize}

\section*{Scientific program}
\noindent
We will maintain the traditional structure of few-body conferences lasting 5 days, from Monday
to Friday. We will leave Wednesday afternoon for excursion and/or discussions. We will have plenary sessions
in the mornings and parallel sessions in the afternoons. There will be about 30 plenary talks lasting
30 minutes, including the talks by young researcher awardees. Depending on the total number of
participants we will have either two or three parallel sessions. We will have a poster session as well.
We also plan to host a public lecture of general interest for participants and the public on a topic related
to the conference theme. 

\section*{Social program}
\noindent
Social program will include a welcome reception (at MFF UK), conference dinner (in the Prague center). 
We also will organize Prague city center excursion and excursions to ÚJF / MFF UK laboratories.

\section*{Registration fee will include}
\noindent
Conference kit, coffee breaks, lunches, welcome reception, conference dinner, excursions plus
meeting rooms,  audio visual equipment,  free WiFi. We will have an early bird registration fee and
reduced fee for students. No on-line participants are planned. 

Lunches (preliminary) will be organized at Menza Troja (Pátkova 3, Praha 8), in walking distance from
the conference place.

%Fee for an accompanying person will include welcome reception and the conference dinner (?).
%{\bf Plus:} 


\section*{Budget}
\noindent
We assumed 150 participants, among them 30 students in estimating the conference fee.
We hope to get extra funding from the NPI and will apply for support from NUPECC.
In addition, we will use any other emerging opportunity to apply for the conference
support, thereby reducing the fee and making support possible for those with special circumstances.

We plan to publish proceedings online or to use the same scheme as at the EFB25 conference, when
the journal "Few Body Systems" publish a special issue with the papers from oral presenters and
selected posters (if editors of FBS agree).

%We show our estimates in the Table below which includes both lower and higher estimates. The upper
%estimate is calculated assuming a conservative possible rise of 20 \% in prices in three years time.  
%CZK/EUR exchange rate (CZK = Czech koruna) will also play a role (1 EUR = 24.66 CZK at 25.10.23).
%
We plan to keep the fees at the level of the EFB25 conference:
\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\hline \\[-1mm]
 &   Price in EUR  \\[1mm]
\hline \\[-1mm]
 Early-bird fee & 500  \\[1mm]
 Full fee &  550 \\[1mm]
 Early-bird student fee & 350  \\[1mm]
 Full student fee &  400 \\[1mm]
% Accompanying person fee & number  \\[1mm]
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section*{Accommodation}
\noindent
Accommodation will not be included in the registration fee and must be organized by the participants.
Prague offers many possibilities for accommodation which can be found using usual booking portals. Close
to “Nádraží Holešovice” metro station are situated: Plaza Prague Hotel, Hotel Extol Inn Praha, Hotel Expo, Hotel
Castle Residence. We intend to arrange accommodation for reduced rates in selected hotels during the time of
the conference. The typical current costs per night ranges from about 75 EUR.

\paragraph{For students} we plan to arrange and offer inexpensive accommodation at the nearby dormitory \href{https://kam.cuni.cz/KAMEN-54.html}{``Kolej 17.\ Listopadu''}.
%(Pátkova 2136/3, Prague 8).

\section*{Other information}

\paragraph{Academic and Medical Conference Agency (AMCA)}
Services of AMCA will be used for registration, conference fee
collecting, book of abstract printing, catering, social dinner.

\paragraph{Visa requirements}
Czech Republic does not require visas from EU/EEA citizens for stays
of any duration or for any purpose. Citizens of Australia, Brazil,
Canada, Israel, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, South Korea, Taiwan, the
US and some other countries will also not need a visa for stays of
up to 90 days. Citizens of China, India, Iran, Pakistan, Russia, South
Africa, Turkey and some
\href{https://www.mzv.cz/jnp/en/information_for_aliens/short_stay_visa/list_of_states_whose_citizens_are/index.html}{other countries} require a visa.
% We will provide
% letters of invitation to those participants who need visas well in
% advance and will recommend they apply for the visa well in advance.

\paragraph{Weather}
Daytime high temperatures in Prague tend to be around 24 ${}^\circ$C early in August but fall off to near
